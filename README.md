## Assignment 2 (FairPrice) (Victoria and Priyanka)

This website is a Fairprice e-commerce website for consumers to choose their desired items and add it to their shopping cart. As Fairprice has many items for sale, we will only be focusing on a few products from 3 categories, snacks, household and frozen products. Users would then be able to have the products delivered to their doorstep. We will also include a quiz section, to test users after they have read what FairPrice is about so that they can gain more knowledge about FairPrice. And, in exchange, they can collect vouchers.

# Design Process

This website is built for people in Singapore to order products from Fairprice and to find out more about FairPrice. They would also be able to see what promotions FairPrice has which would entice them to place an order.
FairPrice Online is the e-commerce portal of NTUC Fairprice Co-operative Ltd, Singaporeâ€™s largest grocery retailer. With this website, users can shop for a wide range of products, ranging from snacks to household products. Have them delivered to your door, or choose the most convenient time and place for pickup. Enjoy an effortless shopping experience with FairPrice Online, whether from your computer, tablet or mobile phone.

# User Stories:

- As a consumer, I would want to be able to order FairPrice products online and have it delivered to my doorstep, making it more convenient for myself and so that I would not have to spend time travelling down to a physical store and having to look around for my item. With the products in the website organised according to categories, it would be easier to find the product that I need. I would also not have to queue up to make payment at the physical store, which may take some time if there are many people in the queue.
- Through this website, I would also be able to learn more about FairPrice and take the quiz to see how much I have learnt from the website and in turn claim vouchers which I can use when checking out.
