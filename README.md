## Assignment 2 (Adidas Website)

This website is a Fairprice e-commerce website for consumers to choose their desired items and add it to their shopping cart. As Fairprice has many items for sale, we will only be focusing on a few products from 3 categories, snacks, household and frozen products. Users would then be able to have the products delivered to their doorstep. We will also include a quiz section, to test users after they have read what FairPrice is about so that they can gain more knowledge about FairPrice. And, in exchange, they can collect vouchers.

NTUC FairPrice is the largest supermarket chain in Singapore, with over 100 supermarkets island-wide.

# Design Process

This website is built for people in Singapore to order products from Fairprice and to find out more about FairPrice. They would also be able to see what promotions FairPrice has which would entice them to place an order.

# User Stories:

- As a Singaporean, I want to find out what local productions has to offer in terms of media from sources such as films and music so that I can support the local industry. I would also be able to improve my command of Chinese Language.
- As a foreigner, I am interested to find out more about Singapores culture and how different media is produced in Singapore in a more accessible way.
